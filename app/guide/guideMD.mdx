# **ðŸŽ„ Hacky Holidays Guide**
Hacky Holidays is a limited time YSWS event for making your own PCB tree decorations! There are **3** major steps in making a successful decoration:

1. Choosing your Parts
2. Designing your PCB
3. Programming your PCB

### **** This guide serves as a learning tool to help you get started, If you submit the guide PCB you will not be accepted! ****

# Choosing Your Parts

When choosing your parts, think about the function of each component, and try to wither out unneeded components. Unneeded components can reduce your decorationâ€™s battery life!

Parts covered in the guide **(THESE MUST BE ON YOUR PCB TO WORK):**

- Neopixels
- MCU (separate guides for the ESP32 and ch552)
- Batteries

If you want to add any components **not** on the approved list, ask one of the organizers in #hacky-holidays!

# **Designing your PCB**

For this guide, we are going to be using KiCad, so if you are using a different tool your steps might be a bit different! 

First, open up KiCad, and go to File â†’ New Projectâ€¦ and name it whatever you want! Just make sure you name it something you remember so you can come back to it :P

Then Click on the **Schematic Editor** Button. It will take you to a blank page where you will start designing your PCB!
